## 🚚 Supply Chain Data Pipeline

## 📦 Project Overview  
This project explores real-world retail supply chain data from Kaggle to build a complete data analysis pipeline.  
It includes SQL querying, Python-based preprocessing, and business dashboards to uncover patterns in transportation, cost, and customer behavior.

## 🎯 Business Objective  
To help retail and logistics teams improve supply chain efficiency by analyzing how transportation modes, product importance, and discount levels affect costs and customer satisfaction.

## 🧱 Data Pipeline Architecture  
- **Data Source:** Retail Supply Chain Transaction Dataset (Kaggle)  
- **SQL Layer:** Extract structured insights on transport mode, cost, discounts, and ratings  
- **Python Layer:** Preprocessing, correlation checks, and grouping logic (Google Colab)  
- **Visualization Layer:**  
  - Tableau: Distribution by shipment type and product category  
  - Power BI: Cost vs discount vs customer rating dashboards

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** SQL, Python (pandas, matplotlib)  
- **Platforms:** Google Colab, GitHub, Kaggle  
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau Public, Power BI  
- **Data Size:** 10K+ transactions, 4 key features analyzed across logistics categories

## 📊 Key Insights  
- 🚚 Distribution of shipping modes across order volume  
- 📉 High product discounts often correlate with lower customer ratings  
- 🧮 Scatter plots reveal complex interactions between freight cost and product importance
