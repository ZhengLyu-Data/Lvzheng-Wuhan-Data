# 🚚 Supply Chain Dashboard

This project explores a simulated supply chain dataset using Python and Tableau. It focuses on understanding order distribution, transport efficiency, and cost dynamics across different cities and delivery methods. The project demonstrates full cloud-based development and cross-platform tool integration (Colab + Tableau + GitHub).

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Clean and prepare supply chain order data using Python (in Google Colab)
- Analyze shipping origin, transport time, and delivery cost
- Create 3 insightful visualizations
- Build a comprehensive interactive dashboard in Tableau Public

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard (Interactive)

🔗 [View the Live Dashboard on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zheng.lyu6601/viz/SupplyChainDashboard_17487579608020/SupplyChainDashboard)

The dashboard includes 3 key visualizations:

1. **Orders by Origin City**  
   - Shows the number of orders shipped from each origin city.
2. **Average Delivery Time by Transport Method**  
   - Compares delivery speed across Air, Rail, Truck, and Ship.
3. **Distance vs. Transport Cost**  
   - A scatter plot to evaluate the relationship between delivery distance and cost.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Major shipping volumes are concentrated in cities like Wuhan, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
- **Air** transport is the fastest but also has higher cost variance.
- There's a visible correlation between **longer distances and higher transport costs**, with outliers worth investigating.

## 📓 Notebook Format Notice

The notebook `supply_chain_dashboard.ipynb` was created and executed in **Google Colab**.  
It includes full output and markdown commentary, demonstrating cloud-based data analytics workflow.

## ✅ Outcome

This project reflects real-world supply chain analytics tasks and shows proficiency in:
- Python-based data cleaning and transformation
- Tableau-based visual storytelling
- GitHub-based cloud project documentation

It is part of a 4-project portfolio designed to support data analyst job applications in enterprise or global settings.
