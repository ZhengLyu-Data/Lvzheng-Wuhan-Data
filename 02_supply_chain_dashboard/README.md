# 📦 Project 2: Supply Chain Dashboard

This project demonstrates supply chain data processing and visualization using cloud tools and cross-platform collaboration.

---

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze supplier and product performance based on a simulated order dataset. It includes:

- Cleaning raw supply chain order data with Python (Google Colab)
- Visualizing insights through Tableau Public
- Executing SQL queries using SQLFiddle (MySQL 5.6)

---

## 🧼 Data Cleaning (Python via Google Colab)

The original dataset was cleaned using Python in Google Colab.  
Cleaning steps included:
- Handling null values
- Removing duplicate records
- Standardizing date formats
- Exporting `cleaned_supply_orders.csv` for visualization and SQL query

Includes:
- Total order quantity by product
- Supplier-wise shipment comparison
- Monthly order trend

SQL logic includes:
- Table creation
- Simulated supplier data insertion
- Ranking suppliers by total quantity
