📦 02_Supply_Chain_Analysis_Pro
🔍 Project Overview
This project provides an end-to-end supply chain analysis using real-world datasets to simulate key business scenarios. It integrates data exploration, SQL querying, Python-based analysis, and both Tableau and Power BI dashboards. The goal is to identify bottlenecks, evaluate carrier performance, and optimize cost-efficiency in shipping and inventory decisions.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (Google Colab)

SQL (Programiz / SQLFiddle)

Tableau (Public Dashboard)

Power BI (Desktop Reports)

📊 Key Insights & Outputs
Carrier Efficiency: Identified top-performing shipping carriers by cost and delivery time.

Geographic Bottlenecks: Mapped high-delay regions for targeted improvement.

Shipping Cost Patterns: Visualized correlations between distance, time, and cost.

Dashboard Summary: Interactive Tableau & Power BI dashboards to support supply chain decisions.
