## Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes customer product reviews from the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to clean the raw text data, predict sentiment (positive/neutral/negative), visualize insights, and build a simple classification model.

## Data Cleaning

- Removed null entries and unnecessary columns
- Standardized text to lowercase and removed punctuation/special characters
- Sampled 20,000 reviews from the full dataset (~500,000 rows)
- Exported cleaned and labeled data for modeling

---

## Key Insights

- Majority of reviews in the dataset are positive
- TextBlob provides an efficient way to label sentiment with minimal configuration
- Logistic regression based on TF-IDF features achieved meaningful performance for binary classification (positive vs. negative)
- Visualizations such as word clouds and sentiment distribution help interpret the data effectively

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- TextBlob
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- WordCloud

## ðŸ“¦ Raw Data Access

Due to GitHub file size limits, the original dataset has been split into six parts:

- `amazon_reviews_raw_part1.csv`
- ...
- `amazon_reviews_raw_part6.csv`

Each part contains 100,000 rows from the original dataset (~500,000 rows total).

To reconstruct or process, simply read them in sequence using Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.concat([
    pd.read_csv("amazon_reviews_raw_part1.csv"),
    pd.read_csv("amazon_reviews_raw_part2.csv"),
    ...
])
