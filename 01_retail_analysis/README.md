# 🛒 Project 1: Retail Sales Analysis

This project explores a sample retail dataset to identify sales trends across time, countries, and product categories using Python and Tableau.

## 📌 Objective
To analyze historical retail sales data and uncover actionable insights on:
- Monthly sales trends
- Sales performance by country
- Product-based revenue breakdown

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Google Colab (Python, Pandas)
- Tableau Public (for visualization)
- GitHub (for version control)

## 📊 Key Visualizations
1. **Monthly Sales Trend:** Shows total sales by month using line chart.
2. **Sales by Country:** Compares country-wise sales using bar chart.
3. **Sales by Product:** Displays category-wise revenue distribution using pie chart.

## 🧪 Data Processing Steps
1. Load raw CSV into Colab
2. Clean missing/null values with median strategy
3. Export cleaned data for visualization

## 📓 Notebook Format Notice
The Colab notebook file is currently named `Notebook.ipynb` due to session constraints. All code, documentation, and steps follow a modular format. You can open the notebook directly in Google Colab.
