## 📈 Tableau Dashboard (Interactive)

🔗 [View Live Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zheng.lyu6601/viz/GlobalRetailAnalysis_17487317429280/GlobalRetailAnalysis)

This dashboard includes the following views:

1. **Monthly Sales Trend**  
   - Time-series chart showing sales fluctuations by month to identify seasonality and growth patterns.

2. **Sales by Country**  
   - Horizontal bar chart comparing total revenue across countries, highlighting high-performing regions.

3. **Sales by Product**  
   - Pie chart showing quantity sold per product, revealing top-selling items and product mix.

📌 A visual preview is available in the file `tableau_screenshot.png`.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📈 Sales peaked during **Q4**, especially in **November and December**, indicating strong seasonal demand.
- 🌍 The **United States**, **United Kingdom**, and **Germany** are the top 3 revenue-generating countries.
- 📦 The product with the highest quantity sold is likely a **high-volume, low-margin** item, which requires bundling strategy.

> These insights are based on the sample dataset and demonstrate core analytical skills.

## 📓 Notebook Format Notice

The main analysis file is named `Notebook.ipynb`, and it is a standard **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** created and executed in **Google Colab**.

⚠️ The filename has been intentionally kept as `Notebook.ipynb` to preserve the notebook's full execution history and cell outputs. Renaming directly in GitHub may break the file structure or delete outputs.

You can open and interact with the notebook directly in your browser via Google Colab:

➡️ **How to open in Colab:**
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click `File → Open notebook → GitHub` tab
3. Paste this repo URL:  
   `https://github.com/ZhengLyu-Data/Lvzheng-Wuhan-Data`
4. Navigate to:  
   `01_retail_analysis/Notebook.ipynb`
