📁 Project 01: Retail Sales Analysis

📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes global retail sales data using Python, Google Colab, and Tableau Public. The goal is to identify trends, geographic sales distribution, and product performance using a fully cloud-based workflow.

🛠️ Tools Used

Google Colab – Python data processing and cleaning
Pandas – Data manipulation
Tableau Public – Interactive data visualization
GitHub – Version control and portfolio hosting

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains sales transactions across different countries and product categories. 
It includes:
Date of sale
Country
Product name
Quantity and Unit Price

🧹 Data Cleaning (Python on Colab)
