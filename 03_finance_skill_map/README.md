## 📊 Project 3: Finance Skill Map

## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes financial skill development across departments. Using a cleaned dataset of training hours, skill categories, and proficiency levels, we visualized trends to support talent management decisions.

## 📁 Dataset
**Filename:** `cleaned_financial_skills.csv`  
**Fields:**
- `Skill`: Name of the financial skill
- `Category`: Classification of the skill (e.g., Reporting, Analysis)
- `Department`: Department where the skill is applied
- `TrainingHours`: Total hours spent on training
- `ProficiencyLevel`: Self-reported skill proficiency level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard
A dynamic dashboard was created using Tableau, highlighting three core perspectives of financial skills across departments.

### 📌 Key Visualizations:
1. **Average Training Hours per Skill**  
   Horizontal bar chart showing average training time by skill.

2. **Skill Distribution by Department and Category**  
   Stacked bar chart showing the count of skills by department and skill category.

3. **Skill Category by Proficiency Level**  
   Heatmap indicating how different skill categories are distributed across proficiency levels.
